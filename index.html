		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<img src="assets/images/running.jpeg">
		
		<p>Hello, I'm an avid runner who has a passion for anything related to the outdoors.  I enjoy cycling, swimming, mountain biking, canoeing and anything that involves being phisically active. I log in about 8 miles of running daily, but now that I am persuing a new love in life that is the love for coding all that has changed.  I have to share time so I can happily enjoy both.</p>
